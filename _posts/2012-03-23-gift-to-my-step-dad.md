It was my step-dad's birthday recently and, as usual, I was struggling to think of a gift. We had both just finished reading [Angelmaker](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Angelmaker-Nick-Harkaway/dp/043402094X) and this gave me an inkling of an idea. Using the power of twitter, I decided to chance my arm and contact the author ([Nick Harkaway](http://www.nickharkaway.com/)) to ask if he wanted to be a participant in a most fiendish scheme!

Unfortunately he declined, but he did agree to sign a copy of the book!

But it turned out that not only did he sign the book, he included a birthday card as well. So a big thank you to Nick Harkaway for making a present I'm sure my step-dad will cherish.
