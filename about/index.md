Hi, I'm Tom
-----------

I'm a developer living in London. I work at [Caffeinehit](http://caffeinehit.com) in [Caffeinehit HQ](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Caffeinehit+Ltd,+Rivington+Street,+London&hl=en&ll=51.525967,-0.080724&spn=0.006769,0.01929&sll=51.523431,-0.077376&sspn=0.014205,0.038581&z=16) doing awesome stuff with [awesome](http://twitter.com/caffeinehit) [people](http://twitter.com/flashingpumpkin).

I mainly use [python](http://python.org) and [django](http://djangoproject.com) but I also use [objective-c](http://developer.apple.com), [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript), [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.com) through choice plus [java](http://java.com) and [php](http://php.net) if I really have to. I'm also interested in other languages like [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), [erlang](http://erlang.org), [lisp](http://www.common-lisp.net) and [haskell](http://haskell.org) although I cannot claim to know them yet.

When not working I can often be found listening to [music](http://last.fm/user/spl1nter) (either recorded or live), trying out new food, running (or, more accurately, being out of breath).

My favourite emoticon is ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I'm prone to random acts of prose.
